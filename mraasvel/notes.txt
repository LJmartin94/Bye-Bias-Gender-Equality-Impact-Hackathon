pandas array:

Selecting specific rows and columns and items

	https://www.shanelynn.ie/select-pandas-dataframe-rows-and-columns-using-iloc-loc-and-ix/#iloc-selection
	# Multiple row and column selections using iloc and DataFrame

		data.iloc[0:5] # first five rows of dataframe
		data.iloc[:, 0:2] # first two columns of data frame with all rows
		data.iloc[[0,3,6,24], [0,5,6]] # 1st, 4th, 7th, 25th row + 1st 6th 7th columns.
		data.iloc[0:5, 5:8] # first 5 rows and 5th, 6th, 7th columns of data frame (county -> phone1).

labelencoder = LabelEncoder()
X.iloc[:,1] = labelencoder.fit_transform(X.iloc[:,1])


Multiple string comparisons:

	df = df.loc[df['Gender'].isin(['Male', 'Female'])] # Comparing multiple types using isin


Extract columns:

	df = df.iloc[:, [56,26,27]] # extract column index 56, 26, 27 etc (see index.txt)


Filtering:

	# df = df.loc[df['CurrencySymbol'] == 'USD'] # only locate where CurrencySymbol = USD
	# df = df.drop(labels = 'CurrencySymbol', axis = 1) # drop means to remove label axis=1 means column





Mean:

	print("Male mean exp: ", mdf['YearsCodingProf'].mean())
